# Mean-Field Theory
This program is developed to solve self-consistent equation due to the application of the mean-field theory(MFT) in quantum spin systems.
 
# Features
`./manysub/mf.hpp` is a file applying MFT in a quantum spin model and solving self-consistent equation. Information about system, for example, the structure of lattice, the number of sublattices and spinã€€interaction, *etc.* is entered in `~.cpp` file.
